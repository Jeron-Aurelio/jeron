###1.The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
shoe_data <- data.frame(
  ShoeSize = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 7.0, 7.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5,
               13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 10.5, 8.0, 11.0, 9.0, 13.0),
  Height = c(66.0, 68.0, 64.5, 65.0, 70.0, 70.0, 71.0, 72.0, 64.0, 64.0, 67.0, 71.0,
             77.0, 72.0, 59.0, 60.0, 72.0, 66.0, 64.0, 69.0, 67.0, 70.0, 69.0, 70.0),
  Gender = c('F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'M',
             'M', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'F', 'M', 'F', 'M', 'M', 'M')
)
shoe_data

### A. Describe data
summary(shoe_data)

### B.Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.What its result? Show the R scripts.
female_data <- subset(shoe_data, Gender == "F", select = c(ShoeSize, Height))
female_data

male_data <- subset(shoe_data, Gender == "M", select = c(ShoeSize, Height))
male_data

### C.Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
mean_shoe <- mean(shoe_data$ShoeSize)
mean_height <- mean(shoe_data$Height)

mean_shoe
mean_height

# D
correlation <- cor(shoe_data$ShoeSize, shoe_data$Height)
correlation
```
```{r}
### 2.Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
# Character vector of months (copied exactly)
months_vector <- c("March","April","January","November","January",
                   "September","October","September","November","August",
                   "January","November","November","February","May","August",
                   "July","December","August","August","September","November",
                   "February","April")

factor_months_vector <- factor(months_vector)

factor_months_vector
```
```{r}
### 3.Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
summary("months_vector")
summary("factor_months_vector")
```
```{r}
### 4.Create a vector and factor for the table below.
direction <- c("East", "West", "North")
frequency <- c(1, 4, 3)

factor_data <- factor(direction, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))

print(factor_data)

table_data <- data.frame(Direction = factor_data, Frequency = frequency)
print(table_data)
```

```{r}
### 6.Full Search
if (interactive()) {
  mode <- tolower(trimws(readline("Enter mode ('r' for random, 'm' for manual): ")))
} else {
  mode <- "r"
}

if (mode == "r") {
  chosen <- sample(1:50, 1)
  cat("Randomly chosen number:", chosen, "\n")
} else if (mode == "m") {
  if (interactive()) {
    input <- readline("Enter an integer: ")
    chosen_num <- suppressWarnings(as.integer(input))
    if (is.na(chosen_num)) stop("Invalid input: please enter an integer.")
    chosen <- chosen_num
  } else {
    chosen <- 20
    cat("Default number selected for knitting:", chosen, "\n")
  }
} else {
  stop("Invalid mode. Use 'r' or 'm'.")
}

if (chosen < 1 || chosen > 50) {
  cat("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50\n")
} else if (chosen == 20) {
  cat("TRUE\n")
} else {
  cat("Selected number:", chosen, "\n")
}
```

### 7.Change
min_bills <- function(price) {
  bills <- c(1000, 500, 200, 100, 50)
  count <- 0
  
  remaining <- price
  
  for (b in bills) {
    if (remaining >= b) {
      n <- remaining %/% b     # how many of that bill
      count <- count + n
      remaining <- remaining - n*b
    }
  }
  
  return(count)
}

price <- sample(seq(50, 5000, by = 50), 1)
cat("Price of snack:", price, "\n")
cat("Minimum bills needed:", min_bills(price), "\n")
```

```{r}
### 8.The following is each student’s math score for one semester. Based on this, answer the following questions.

### A. Create a dataframe from the above table. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}
math_scores <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)

print(math_scores)

```

### B. Without using the rowMean function, output the average score of students whose average
math score over 90 points during the semester. write R code and its output.

```{r}
average_scores <- (math_scores$Grade1 + math_scores$Grade2 + math_scores$Grade3 + math_scores$Grade4) / 4

average_scores

high_achievers <- math_scores[average_scores > 90, ]

high_achievers

```

### C. Without using the mean function, output as follows for the tests in which the average
score was less than 80 out of 4 tests.



```{r}
average_scores <- (math_scores$Grade1 + math_scores$Grade2 + math_scores$Grade3 + math_scores$Grade4) / 4

average_scores

low_scores <- math_scores[average_scores < 80, ]

low_scores
```


### D. Without using the max function, output as follows for students whose highest score for a semester exceeds 90 points..

```{r}

for (i in 1:nrow(math_scores)) {
  
  grades <- c(math_scores$Grade1[i], math_scores$Grade2[i], math_scores$Grade3[i], math_scores$Grade4[i])
  

  highest <- grades[1]          
  for (g in grades) {
    if (g > highest) {
      highest <- g
    }
  }
  
  if (highest > 90) {
    cat(math_scores$Name[i], "'s highest grade this semester is", highest, "\n")
  }
}

```
